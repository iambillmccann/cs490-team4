# How To Initialize And Run The FastAPI Endpoints

1. First you will need to initialize a local python environment in the root directory of the project. Run `python3 -m venv venv` while
   in <b>cs490-team4</b> folder.
2. After initializing the virtual environment, it should create a folder in your directory called <b>venv</b>.
3. Next, if the virtual environment did not activate for you, run `source venv/bin/activate`.
4. In your cli, you should see <b>(venv)</b> at the beginning of the prompt.
5. Then, run `pip install -r requiremenets.txt`. This will install all the packages necessary to run the project.
6. To run the API, in your console type in `fastapi dev backend/app.py`. This should enable the FastAPI endpoints on port 8000. To see the
